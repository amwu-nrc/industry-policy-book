# Aviation

## Industry Overview

The commercial airline industry employs approximately **33,500 workers** across domestic and international carriers in Australia, including charter services, pilot training, corporate jets, and regional aircraft operators.  

However, this industry mapping report focuses exclusively on those who work in Aircraft Manufacturing and Repair Services, which employs between **7,3001** by the ABS/Census count and **12,5002** workers by the IBISWorld count. Given the impact on the commercial aviation industry from the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 Census is likely to represent a significant undercount of employment.  

The commercial airline industry faced significant challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic, with reduced flights. The industry has since recovered, with revenue now reaching close to pre-pandemic levels.  This recovery, combined with Defence spending, has increased the demand for aircraft maintenance and repair workers.  

This report is intended to provide guidance about current aircraft manufacturing in Australia, including industry trends, and an overview of our current membership in this sector.  

Domestic airline operation in Australia also contributes to the local workforce for Aircraft Manufacturing and Repair Services – with Qantas employing about 3,300 personnel in their engineering and maintenance branch.

## Opportunities

Increased demand for domestic and international travel leads to growth through increased requirements for maintenance and repair services.

The future of Rex - The government has pledged to buy Rex if no buyer is able to be found. The AFR reporting as of 24th September indicates that a US firm Air T may purchase. Rex's planes are Saabs, which are no longer being made. New planes might need to be purchased.

Other opportunities include in the manufacturing of sustainable aviation fuel, supported by the low carbon liquid fuels stream of FMIA, and the newly announced Cleaner Fuels Program. The production of LCLF is not expected until 2029. Sustainable aviation fuels are made using non-food crops et al. which are already exported from Australia - including sorghum, canola, sugar, and waste products.

-   what and where are the opportunities for growth?

-   is there an opportunity to use multi-employer bargaining, same job same pay, or other tools?

**government support**

significant government support is available in the production of low-carbon/sustainable aviation fuels, through the \$250 million Low Carbon Liquid Fuels stream of FMIA, and the recent announcement of the Cleaner Fuels Program.

-   \$250 million to Low Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLF) including sustainable aviation fuels and renewable diesel.

-   announcement of \$1.1 billion over 10 years through the Cleaner Fuels Program to stimulate private investment in onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.
