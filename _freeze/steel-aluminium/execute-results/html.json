All aspects of the industry are facing increasing pressures from low-cost imports, especially in the face of rising input costs in Australia. Additional uncertainty surrounding international trade policy clouds future investment decisions. Within the steel manufacturing and structural steel fabricating industries, pressures from automation and AI adoption have reduced wage costs and impacted the labour market. Future revenue growth in these sectors may rely on increased demand for green steel – indicating the importance for local manufacturers to invest in these production technologies now.\n\nBoth the iron and steel casting and forging industries have faced declining revenue over the last five years. Revenue has reduced at an annualized rate of 7.7%, primarily due to the continued impacts of the decline of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry and increased import competition. In iron and steel forging, deteriorating conditions in mining output and railway equipment manufacturing has resulted in an annualised revenue decline of 2.4% through to 2024-25.\n\nHowever, future growth is predicted as population growth increases pressure on existing infrastructure – increasing demand for multi-unit apartments, townhouses, and railway equipment. The completion of existing large infrastructure projects will dampen future sales without a strong pipeline of additional work. Finally, there is an opportunity through increased demand for wind farm construction to support the iron and steel forging industry.\n\n### Aluminium\n\n-   The aluminium industry is nominally comprised of:\n\n    -   Aluminium Smelting\n\n    -   Alumina Production\n\n    -   Aluminium Rolling, Drawing and Extruding\n\nThe aluminium industry in Australia comprises the entire supply chain from Aluminium ore through to manufactured aluminium. These two industries employ 6,853 and 3,245 people respectively. products.\n\nFinancial analysis from IBISWorld indicates that the Alumina Production industry in Australia is worth \\$6.7 billion, employing more than 6,800 employees, across only three businesses.  Aluminium smelting is a less concentrated industry, worth \\$6.8 billion, employing 3,245 employees across 57 businesses.\n\n-   is the industry in growth or decline?\n\n    -   employment\n\n    -   output\n\n    -   revenue\n\n## Opportunities\n\nwhat and where are the opportunities for growth?\n\n### Legislation\n\n-   Multi-employer bargaining\n\n-   Same Job Same Pay\n\n### Government Funding\n\n-   is there an opportunity to use multi-employer bargaining, same job same pay, or other tools?\n\n-   is there an opportunity to use FMIA\n\n## Conclusion\n\n-   summary\n\n-   any other issues\n",
