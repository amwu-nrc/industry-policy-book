  abstract = {Abstract             In contrast to the majority of studies that have treated informal workers as a single homogeneous group, this article accounts for the possibility of ``winners'' and ``losers'' among informal workers. Applying unconditional quantile regressions to data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, the authors are able to estimate the formal--informal wage gaps for different segments of the earnings distribution. Although the evidence confirms the existence of a substantial earnings penalty for many informal workers, there is also a group who earn roughly similar incomes to formal workers. The findings are consistent with Fields's (1990 and 2005) model of heterogeneous informal employment.},

  abstract = {How much knowledge is there in an economy? In recent years, data on the mix of products that countries export has been used to construct measures of economic complexity that estimate the knowledge available in an economy and predict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new and simpler metric of economic complexity (ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy corrected by how difficult it is to export each product. We use data from 1973 to 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), and Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and 20-year panels in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects model. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI and Fitness in its ability to predict economic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across most econometric specifications. On average, one standard deviation increase in ECI+ is associated with an increase in annualized growth of about 4\% to 5\%. We then combine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human capital, and institutions, to find a robust model of economic growth. The ability of ECI+ to predict growth, and the value of its coefficient, is robust to these controls. Also, we find that human capital, political stability, and control of corruption; are positively associated with future economic growth, and that income is negatively associated with growth, in agreement with the traditional growth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions for the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained using ECI and Fitness. These findings improve the methods available to estimate the knowledge intensity of economies and predict future economic growth.},

This approach provides insights into the interplay between wages and the complexity or relatedness of the skill sets within each occupation, complementing conventional human capital frameworks. Our empirical strategy is threefold. First, we construct the Job and~Skill Progression Networks, where nodes represent jobs (skills) and a link between two jobs (skills) indicates statistically significant co-occurrence of skills required to carry out those two jobs, that can be useful tools to identify job-switching paths and skill complementarities Second, by harnessing the Fitness and Complexity algorithm, we define a data-driven skill-based complexity measure of jobs that positively maps, but with interesting deviations, into wages and in the bottom--up~and broad abstract/manual and routine/non-routine job characterisations, however providing a continuous and endogenous metric to assess the degree of complexity of each occupational skill-set. Third, building on relatedness and corporate coherence metrics, we introduce a measure of each~job's skill coherence, that negatively maps into wages. Our findings may inform policymakers and employers on designing more effective labour market policies and training schemes, that, rather than fostering hyper-specialization, should favor the acquisition of complex and ``uncoherent'' skill sets, enabling workers to more easily move throughout the job and skill progression networks and make informed career choices decisions while unlocking higher wage opportunities.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The International Labour Organization (ILO) has emphasized advancing decent employment in global supply chains. Supply chains (SC) are responsible for the growth of any economy and are positively correlated with job creation. However, studies show that decent working conditions are becoming a major concern. Hence, this study is a modest attempt to examine the shortcomings that result in a lack of decent working conditions in global SCs' and further discuss what kind of guidelines, programs, policies, initiatives or principles are necessary to stimulate decent jobs and/or make it easier to enhance decent working conditions in SC.                                         Design/methodology/approach                                The present paper first applied the systematic literature review and second used the TCM (Theory-Context-Methods), which is a framework-based review, further reporting the analysis of 59 journal research articles/papers listed in the                 Scopus                 database.                                                        Findings               The most commonly used theories in the selected studies are institutional theory. As per these theories, governance, rules and regulations play a crucial role in stopping forced labour, child labour practices and social injustice among workers. The findings of this study comply with SDG eight, which states the significance of decent working conditions. Further, the topic modeling reveals four themes: (1) Nature of working conditions (2) Corporate legitimacy (3) Corporate governance mechanisms and (4) Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and ethics in firms. Lastly, we proposed a research framework that shows all the leading factors that influence working conditions in the supply chain.                                         Practical implications               Managers must focus on integrating decent working conditions in SC activities~in their respective organizations and factories. Managers must realize and shoulder this responsibility with other top officials in the organization that improving the SC working conditions is the need of the hour. Consultation with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) five (gender equality) (emphasize gender equality); and SDG eight (decent work and economic growth) (promote sustainable economic growth) is also recommended for managers. Lastly, managers need to develop suitable strategies keeping in mind the interplay between the leading factors (such as top management support, organizational culture, SA 8000 certification, occupational health and safety, stop forced labour and child labour practices, ethics training, enforce modern slavery act, global compliance regimes, buyer-supplier joint auditing, social responsible sourcing, stoppage of unauthorized sub-contracting, maintain SC transparency and CSR disclosure).                                         Originality/value               Using systematic literature review and TCM approach has provided some good takeaway points for managers. The study provides a valuable framework and fourteen research propositions which can be tested in the future.},

In contrast to the commonly adopted approach that estimates the impact of economic complexity in a cross-country setting, we use panel data for Brazilian states to identify the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality at the sub-national level. Our findings show that the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality has an inverted U-shape, indicating that growing levels of complexity first worsen and then improve the income distribution in Brazilian states. Our findings also show that this relationship is particularly prominent in those states that have relatively high levels of urbanization and overall development. Furthermore, we identify separate effects on income inequality from the degree to which regional productive structures are characterised by diversity in terms of industries and occupations. These effects are particularly pronounced in less developed states with a more rural character. In combination, these findings confirm the important role that the productive structure plays in processes that drive improvements in income distributions and suggest that more research on this impact is warranted at the regional level.},

We assess the impact of               ECI               on the distribution dynamics of labor productivity by combining growth regression analysis with conditional density estimates. Counterfactual analysis results suggest that               ECI               plays a key role in the observed tendency to polarization of regional labor productivity.

  abstract = {In October of 2017, General Motors Holden's Elizabeth plant produced its last red commodore and, in doing so, marked the end of 70 years of motor vehicle assembly operations in Australia. This closure was distinct from past closures in that although it happened during a period of relative economic stability, there had been a clear and well-documented deterioration in job stability and job quality in Australia over the three preceding decades. To date, there has been relatively little research into the impact of high rates of precarious employment on closures and other mass unemployment events. And, of that pool of research, even less has explored the intersection of these two issues in the Australian landscape. This thesis addressed that oversight. -- Through the design and application of a unique longitudinal, qualitative framework, this thesis' original contribution to knowledge is the confirmation that precarious work poses a significant risk to workers' transition experiences following large scale job loss. By focusing explicitly and exclusively on the presence and impact of precarious work on worker's experiences of employment transition, it proves that job quality must become a central consideration for future worker transition support programs. -- This thesis uses data collected throughout a longitudinal study consisting of three waves of one-on-one semi-structured interviews, conducted at 6-month intervals, with 28 former South Australian automotive manufacturing workers, totalling 79 interviews. It employs a constructivist grounded theory approach and a longitudinal design in order to link the pragmatist intention of democratic social reform with critical inquiry through self-conscious reflexivity. -- The automotive industry was a central producer of secure full-time employment and an anchor for one of the most vertically integrated and complex value chains in Australia. Its closure marked a significant step in the deindustrialisation of the Australian economy, but it also stands out as a significant moment of change for individual workers and their families and communities. -- The central finding of this thesis is that, in the almost three years (29 months) following the industry closure, the only participants not to experience at least one component of precarious work were the three participants who were unable to secure any work. The longitudinal design enabled the researcher to track exposure to precarious work overtime to show that participants' exposure to each of the elements of precarious work fluctuated over the course of the study. This important finding shows that participants' employment outcomes were not static or linear. -- The thesis adds to the literature on contemporary experiences of precarious employment and of industry closure. It provides a (South) Australian context to the experience of both large-scale closures and precarious work. In documenting the transition experiences of former automotive workers, it provides a valuable insight into the differing employment transition experiences of workers from a single large company, General Motors Holden, as compared to smaller supply-chain companies. In doing so, it provides an in-depth account of the human dimension of deindustrialisation and precarious employment, which is currently lacking. -- It contributes to the methodological literature on precarious work through the construction of an operational, qualitative Framework for Employment In/Security for identifying the presence of precarious work based on four reoccurring components across the extant literature: employment in/security; working-time in/security; economic in/security and access to rights and entitlements. -- Finally, this thesis uses the Framework for Employment In/Security as the basis for an experimental Conceptual Model for Employment In/security. The conceptual model is intended to be used as a way of interpreting and understanding the impact and value of secure and precarious work. It draws on the qualitative findings of this thesis, captured at an important moment of change in the Australian employment landscape, to advocate for a big picture understanding of employment security that is directly informed by workers' experiences. -- Interviewing these workers during this moment of change provided an insightful contrast between the incredibly secure work they were leaving and the varyingly precarious work most of them found. In doing so, the thesis found the value of secure work is not necessarily in the specifics of the task at hand, though that is also desirable, but in the stability and security that allows individuals to build friendships, families, and communities, and it is that which fosters the environment of love and fraternity that the participants of this thesis described. -- Historic changes to the employment landscape are on the horizon as Australia begins to transition to a low-carbon economy. This thesis contributes to the literature by showing that precarious work poses a substantial risk to a genuinely just transition for workers who will be affected by those changes. It speaks to the importance of a holistic conception of the value of secure employment and establishes that precarious work must be directly and centrally addressed, as part of future transition programs, to ensure the successful and just transitions of affected workers},

We use the Economic Complexity Index, which links a country's productive structure with the amount of knowledge and know-how embodied in the goods it produces, and the Environmental Performance Index as a measure of environmental performance. We show that moving to higher levels of economic complexity leads to better overall environmental performance, which means that sophistication of exported products does not induce environmental degradation. Nevertheless, we find that the effect of economic complexity on air quality is negative, i.e., exposure to PM2.5, CO                                                   \$\$\_2\$\$                                                                                      2                                                                                       , methane and nitrous oxide emissions increases, and these findings are robust across alternative econometric specifications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent contributions to the literature on industrialization and development have confirmed that manufacturing continues to play a key role as a driver of economic development. As a corollary, these contributions highlight the importance of premature industrialization as a barrier to economic development and as one of the main sources of the middle-income trap. In this paper, we analyze the factors that may have hindered industrial development in the past four decades. In particular, we focus on the role of (non-Foreign Direct Investment) net capital inflows as a potential source of premature deindustrialization. We consider a sample of 36 developed and developing countries from 1980 to 2017, with major emphasis on the case of emerging and developing economies (EDEs) in the context of increasing financial integration. We show that periods of abundant capital inflows may have caused a significant contraction of manufacturing share to employment and GDP, as well as the decrease of the economic complexity index. We also show that the phenomena of ``perverse'' structural changes are significantly more relevant in EDE countries than in advanced ones and that they may similarly occur across EDE countries, regardless of structural differences in the way manufacturing contributed to their development. Based on such evidence, we conclude with some policy suggestions highlighting capital controls and external macroprudential measures taming international capital mobility as useful policy tools for promoting long-run productive development on top of strengthening (short-term) financial and macroeconomic stability.},

One common way of interpreting these data is to see a positive association between job satisfaction and job quality. Another view is to dismiss the usefulness of job satisfaction data, because workers can often express satisfaction with work where job quality is poor. It is argued that this second view has some validity, but that survey data on job satisfaction and subjective well-being at work are informative if interpreted carefully. If researchers are to come to sensible conclusions about the meaning behind job satisfaction data, information about why workers report job satisfaction is needed. It is in the understanding of why workers report feeling satisfied (or dissatisfied) with their jobs that sociology can make a positive contribution.},

  abstract = {Research on productive structures has shown that economic complexity conditions economic growth. However, little is known about which type of complexity, e.g., export or industrial complexity, matters more for regional economic growth in a large emerging country like Brazil. Brazil exports natural resources and agricultural goods, but a large share of the employment derives from services, non-tradables, and within-country manufacturing trade. Here, we use a large dataset on Brazil's formal labor market, including approximately 100 million workers and 581 industries, to reveal the patterns of export complexity, industrial complexity, and economic growth of 558 micro-regions between 2003 and 2019. Our results show that export complexity is more evenly spread than industrial complexity. Only a few---mainly developed urban places---have comparative advantages in sophisticated services. Regressions show that a region's industrial complexity is a significant predictor for 3-year growth prospects, but export complexity is not. Moreover, economic complexity in neighboring regions is significantly associated with economic growth. The results show export complexity does not appropriately depict Brazil's knowledge base and growth opportunities. Instead, promoting the sophistication of the heterogeneous regional industrial structures and development spillovers is a key to growth. This study demonstrates that industrial complexity, which accounts for all employment sectors, provides a more accurate basis for designing effective and inclusive industrial policies in emerging economies like Brazil, compared to export-based complexity.},

At the same time, a micro literature has typically found positive correlations between individual income and individual measures of subjective well-being. This paper suggests that these two findings are consistent with the presence of relative income terms in the utility function. Income may be evaluated relative to others (social comparison) or to oneself in the past (habituation). We review the evidence on relative income from the subjective well-being literature. We also discuss the relation (or not) between happiness and utility, and discuss some nonhappiness research (behavioral, experimental, neurological) related to income comparisons. We last consider how relative income in the utility function can affect economic models of behavior in the domains of consumption, investment, economic growth, savings, taxation, labor supply, wages, and migration.

The authors look at how this affected employment quality, using a composite index based on Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA). They observe a small but widespread improvement in employment quality -- mainly for self-employed women -- brought about by higher earnings, increased social protection and less time-related underemployment. However, a considerable ``quality deficit'' remains, which calls for policies to strengthen labour market institutions and stimulate productivity and investment.},

This renewed interest underscores the need for robust conceptualization of job quality. This article provides background to the renewed interest in job quality and, drawing on the contributions to the Special Issue, starts to map the dimensions of job quality, the factors that influence job quality, and the outcomes or impacts of job quality. We identify a number of emergent themes. First, job quality is a multidimensional phenomenon. Second, multiple factors and forces operating at multiple levels influence job quality. Third, the study of job quality is an inherently multi-disciplinary endeavour. Fourth, job quality is a contextual phenomenon, differing among persons, occupations and labour market segments, societies and historical periods. Our mapping of job quality, and the articles in the Special Issue, provide a foundation and springboard for understanding better the theoretically challenging and policy-relevant issue of job quality.},

Jobs are tracked from 1995 to 2010, across and within 15 European Union countries. The social corporatist countries had the highest Work Quality and lowest dispersion for all four indices. Work Quality and Work Intensity each rose in several countries, and Working Time Quality rose in most. The dispersion of Working Time Quality, Work Intensity, and Good Physical Environment each fell in many countries, and there was little sign of national divergence.},

Applied to European data, there is a monotonic relationship between the job quality index and psychological wellbeing. However, there is a distinctly large increase in psychological wellbeing, and in several measures of work-related wellbeing, between workers in the lowest decile and those in the second lowest decile of job quality. We therefore propose that `bad jobs' should be designated as those in lowest decile. Using this threshold gives a `bad jobs'/ `other jobs' dichotomy that discriminates on wellbeing far better than definitions based only on low earnings and job insecurity. Using multi-level probit analysis, we find that bad jobs are more common in poorer countries and in countries with weaker labour regulation. Three findings differentiate the distributional pattern of bad jobs from that of low-earnings jobs: first, the prevalence of bad jobs is greater in large establishments; second, there is no gender gap in the prevalence of bad jobs; third, working in the private sector raises the chance of being in a bad job but not of being in a low earnings job.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This study aims to bridge the empirical research gap in governance-modulating effects on the link between a country's productive structure and individuals' well-being. In doing so, this study utilizes the economic complexity index to quantify a country's productive structure and the social progress index to measure quality of life. The empirical strategy relies on the system-GMM approach, covering 75 developing countries from 2011 to 2021. The following conclusions were drawn from the empirical analysis. (1) Economic complexity and governance consistently and unconditionally improve quality of life. (2) Governance substantially modulates economic complexity to enhance quality of life, generating an overall positive net effect. (3) The results remain robust and consistent across several GMM specifications, regardless of whether the six governance indicators compiled by the World Bank were clustered using principal component analysis into four categories (i.e., general, political, economic, and institutional) or used individually. (4) Of the six governance indicators, government effectiveness, the rule of law, and control of corruption were found to be particularly significant, as were economic and institutional governance. (5) An additional threshold analysis was implemented to identify the critical governance levels that further improve quality of life. The thresholds for complementary policies are then established as follows: 0.8435, 1.846, and 1.717 for government effectiveness, rule of law, and corruption control, respectively, and 5.59, 3.14, and 3.32 for general, institutional, and economic governance, respectively. Consequently, economic complexity and governance are necessary and sufficient to improve well-being below these thresholds. Complementary policies are, however, necessary to sustain the overall positive impact beyond these thresholds. The findings of this study provide insights into complementary policies for leveraging economic development to improve the well-being of developing countries.},

To assess their labour migration outcomes, this article defines Australian employment rates the year after graduation by two measures. Our first in-depth case study (drawing on the Graduate Destination Survey) compares international students' work status to that of domestic students in 11 professions, from 2007 to 2011. Our second case study (based on the Immigration Department's Continuous Survey of Australia's Migrants) reports the employment rates achieved from 2009 to 2011 by international students who have secured skilled migrant status in Australia, compared with those of skilled category applicants selected off-shore. Empirical analyses such as these are rare in the existing study-migration literature, which is dominated by policy and qualitative perspectives. The findings are relevant to international students as well as policymakers, in a context where governments frame migration policy but employers maintain the power to offer/withhold work.},

Analysis of an establishment-level survey of 1734 call centres revealed that, as expected, call centre job quality was highest in inclusivist regimes (Denmark, Sweden) and higher in dualist regimes (Austria, France) than in market regimes (Canada, UK, USA). Job quality in Germany, a dualist regime, was of a similar level to that in inclusivist regimes. There was also evidence that, only within dualist regimes, job quality was higher in call centres attached to larger firms than in independent call centres. The findings suggest that national institutional regimes are still sufficiently different and influential to produce cross-national variations in job quality, and have not been weakened and homogenized as a result of the internationalization of national economies.},

We study pioneer firms---firms operating in an industry that was not present in a region---because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are workers with experience in a related industry and with work experience in the same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than for nonpioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry-specific knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micromechanisms underlying regional economic diversification.},

  abstract = {Since the physiocrats, agriculture has been seen as a panacea for economic development. However, studies suggest that manufacturing and, recently, advanced service industries are the engine of economic growth. This study analyzes how employment structure contributes to economic complexity (EC) in African countries. To achieve this objective, it uses data spanning 1996--2017 on 27 African countries and applies the ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and system generalized method of moments estimators. Results suggest that due to its inability to admit many divisions or develop production linkages, agriculture's employment growth is negatively associated with EC. Thus, there are better fits for enhancing complex output in Africa than a more significant share of agricultural employment. On the contrary, employment growth in industry and services enhances the production of sophisticated goods. These findings are robust after several sensitivity checks. Among policy implications from these findings, agriculture should shift from subsistence to mechanized farming, allowing excess workers to reallocate to more productive sectors of industry and advanced services.

This index aspires to mitigate data scarcity for cities and to provide policy makers with the tools for monitoring the evolving role of cities in the global economy. Analytically, we implement the economic complexity methodology on data for the ownership, location and economic activities of the world's 3,000 largest firms and their subsidiaries to propose a new indicator that quantifies the network of the largest cities worldwide and the economic activities of their globalized firms. We first show that complex cities are the highly diversified cities that host non-ubiquitous economic activities of firms with global presence. Then, in a sample of EU cities, we show that complex cities tend to be more prosperous, have higher population, and are associated with more jobs, human capital, innovation, technology and transport infrastructure. Last, using OLS methodology and accounting for several other confounders, we show that a higher ECI, at the city level, enhances the resilience of cities to negative economic shocks, i.e., their ability to bounce back after a shock. Specifically, we find that the expected increase of the ratio of employment in 2012 over 2006 is 0.01 (mean: 0.992; standard deviation: 0.081) when the ECI increases by 1 unit (mean: 0.371; standard deviation: 1.094), i.e., a satisfactory pace of recovery, in terms of employment. The ability to diversify in the presence of a shock, the reallocation of factors of production to other sectors and the ability to extract rents associated with those diversified activities, uncovers the mechanics of the ECI index.},

In order to solve these doubts, this paper plans to carry out systematic theoretical analysis and quantitative tests on these problems.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Based on the macroeconomic data of 129 countries from 1995 to 2022, this paper empirically studies the impact of economic complexity on the employment effect and its mechanism channel by building relevant models.                                         Findings               The results show that regional economic complexity can significantly improve the employment effect of society. At the same time, regional economic complexity has an indirect positive role in promoting employment from two aspects: accumulating fiscal surplus and increasing the working-age population. The former can stimulate employment policies by increasing the government's tax sources, while the latter can increase production specialization and complexity by stimulating demand and increasing employment. In~addition, regional economic complexity will lead to job market differentiation, making the boundary between the service sector and the labor market between industry and agriculture and between the informal employment market and the formal employment more obvious, thus triggering the substitution effect of employment.                                         Originality/value               The possible innovations and marginal contributions of this paper are as follows: First, there are many studies on the influencing factors of employment or unemployment, and this paper provides a new research direction for the literature on the influencing factors of employment effect by using the concept of regional economic complexity for the first time. Second, this paper broadens the research perspective of the employment effect of regional economic complexity, divides the employment substitution effect of various sectors from the perspective of industrial structure and further analyzes the employment promotion effect of regional economic complexity.},

The resulting Economic Complexity Index (ECI) correlates strongly with income levels and predicts subsequent economic growth with some statistical precision. We propose an innovation-adjusted ECI (i-ECI) that uses a high-resolution patent--trade concordance to construct trade networks weighted by domestic and international patent application flows. The i-ECI thus reflects firms' decisions about where to seek patent protection on industry-specific inventions, allows for heterogeneity in the relative importance of patenting across industries, and implicitly captures firms' perceived innovation potential in the recipient countries. Although the i-ECI is highly correlated with the ECI (correlation coefficient greater than 92\%), it is a stronger and more statistically precise predictor of economic growth than the unadjusted ECI.},

The ANU scales have been widely used in fields such as sociology, education, economics and health. The new scale has been developed in response to the introduction of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Recent changes in the structure of the labour market are taken into account through the use of 2006 Australian Census data for scale development. In addition, the naming convention of the scale has been revised in order to better reflect its nature: the Australian (AU) Socioeconomic Index (SEI) 2006 (06) or AUSEI06.},

We show that the ECI and PCI are equivalent to a spectral clustering algorithm that partitions a similarity graph into two parts. The measures are also closely related to various dimensionality reduction methods, such as diffusion maps and correspondence analysis. Our results shed new light on the ECI's empirical success in explaining cross-country differences in gross domestic product per capita and economic growth, which is often linked to the diversity of country export baskets. In fact, countries with high (low) ECI tend to specialize in high-PCI (low-PCI) products. We also find that the ECI and PCI uncover specialization patterns across U.S. states and U.K. regions.},

Even in areas of rapid per capita income growth, typified by the Gujarat model of neoliberal state-sponsored technological development, there is a substantial and increasing decent work deficit. Across India more generally, the decent work deficit is, in fact, growing along several dimensions, leading to `growth without development' or `non-inclusive growth'. This article analyses quality of employment in India across subnational spaces -- among states and between rural and urban locations -- using three International Labour Organisation decent work dimensions: `employment opportunity', `social security benefits' and `social dialogue'. The analysis is based on published government data, for the period 1993--1994 to 2011--2012 -- the period covered by the liberalisation experiment. The conclusion is that economic growth has not contributed significantly to employment quality. Although employment opportunity is significantly higher in the developed states, coverage of social security benefits and scope for social dialogue among regular salaried/wage workers are significantly less in these areas than in underdeveloped regions. Indeed, employment opportunity is significantly higher in rural areas, and the condition of workers in urban areas is not significantly better than in rural locations. Furthermore, over time, the difference in quality of employment across subnational spaces has either increased or remained stagnant.             JEL Codes: J00, J81, J21, 018.},

In contrast, the probability of having a high-quality job decreases by 8.3 and 21.4 p.p. due to COVID-19.

Taking into consideration the heterogeneity among European countries, the heterogeneous panel technique is used, including panel estimation through fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). The empirical findings indicate a long-term equilibrium relationship between economic complexity, energy consumption structure and greenhouse gas emission within all three panels. Economic complexity and energy consumption structure have a statistically significant impact on greenhouse gas emission within all panels, but the influence is higher within the subpanel of countries with a lower level of economic complexity, suggesting a higher risk of pollution as the economic complexity grows and as the energy balance inclines in favor of non-renewable energy consumption. Our paper suggests that the economic complexity is a variable that must be taken into consideration when national economic and energy policies are shaped. Finally, policy implications for each panel of countries are discussed.},

  abstract = {We build on the interpretation of the Economic Complexity method as Correspondence Analysis (CA), and propose that the Canonical form of CA (CCA), which originated in the ecology literature, can be used to calculate multi-dimensional economic complexity. The traditional (CA) way of calculating economic complexity includes no "external" information such as countries' development characteristics to facilitate interpretation of "complexity". This has led to a wide range of fairly ad hoc interpretations of economic complexity on the basis of ex-post correlation to a long list of other variables. By the ex-ante inclusion of a number of country variables in the construction of the complexity indicators, CCA enables better interpretation, also in the case of multi-dimensional indicators. The analysis is further facilitated by another element of the ecologists' toolbox, the so-called biplots, which are CCA-based graph embeddings that represent a lower-dimensional product-space in which products and countries are positioned together, in mutual correspondence to each other. We show that in this way, CCA provides a richer account of development in many of its aspects, especially economic growth.},

From 2001 to 2016, women's job demands/engagement and compensation adequacy grew noticeably, and men's job demands/engagement grew somewhat. Since the mid-2000s, job security has fallen for both women and men. Job quality rises with job tenure, work experience and health, and falls following involuntary job changes.},

Without variety, the process of selection, by which certain products and processes of production are favored in the market, cannot operate. Empirical analysis confirms that U.S. production technology, measured by a pair of capital and labor input coefficients, varies markedly over space. Furthermore, the relative positions of regions in a two-dimensional technology-space appears consistent across industries. With industry-mix effects partially removed, multivariate analysis of variance confirms that regional differences in production techniques are statistically significant. Additional investigation reveals that spatial variations in techniques of production persist over time. These findings support the claims of evolutionary theorists, demonstrating that in U.S. manufacturing industries regions tend to move along distinct trajectories of technological change.},

The article documents this at various levels of disaggregation for a large sample covering more than 100 countries over recent decades. The result is highly robust to changes in the sample and specification. The coefficient of unconditional convergence is estimated quite precisely and is large, at between 2--3\% in most specifications and 2.9\% a year in the baseline specification covering 118 countries. The article also finds substantial sigma convergence at the two-digit level for a smaller sample of countries. Despite strong convergence within manufacturing, aggregate convergence fails due to the small share of manufacturing employment in low-income countries and the slow pace of industrialization. Because of data coverage, these findings should be as viewed as applying to the organized, formal parts of manufacturing.},

These are often captured by metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data combine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology, and research combine to explain inclusive green growth.},

  abstract = {Background Recent concerns about population growth and its consequences in Sydney and Melbourne have added momentum to the debate on ways to achieve a more even geographic distribution of population. However, there is little contemporary evidence about the impact of regionally-focused immigration policies in delivering positive migrant outcomes and easing pressures in major cities.Aims The aim of this paper is to compare migration, employment and settlement outcomes between permanent and temporary skilled migrants to South Australia (SA) as well as the factors influencing migrants' decisions to move into and out of the State. Data and methods Data in this paper draws on the South Australian General Skilled Migrant survey of State-sponsored skilled migrants conducted by The University of Adelaide in 2015. Results Lifestyle and employment factors were important in decisions to come to, stay or leave SA. Permanent migrants were more likely to choose SA as a destination because it was perceived as a good place to raise a family, while temporary migrants were more likely to cite employment. Temporary visa holders had relatively poor employment outcomes. Conclusions Temporary and permanent visa holders experienced different settlement and employment outcomes, demonstrating that a more detailed understanding of migrant characteristics and outcomes may be useful in designing and evaluating regionally-focused migration initiatives.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Skilled migration is an important strategy in developed economies seeking to address skills shortages and population ageing. Research on the labour market outcomes of skilled migrants tends to focus on employers' devaluation of skills without considering the role of immigration policy in the migration process. Moreover, there is little understanding of whether efforts to meet employer demands for local qualifications improve labour market outcomes. Drawing on a study on skilled migrants sponsored under the State-Specific and Regional Migration Scheme in the regional state of South Australia, we explore the shaping of skills and skills recognition in the migration journey, particularly migrants' strategy of reskilling in response to employer demands for local qualifications. Our logistic regressions on the association between the acquisition of Australian qualifications and labour market outcomes reveal only marginal returns to these efforts. We argue that Australia should consider developing a more coherent skilled migration process to better harness the human capital of skilled migrants.},

Drawing upon worker experiences with the Deliveroo and UberEATS platforms, it is shown how the labour process controls are multi-facetted and more than algorithmic management, with three distinct features standing out: the panoptic disposition of the technological infrastructure, the use of information asymmetries to constrain worker choice, and the obfuscated nature of their performance management systems. Combined with the workers' precarious labour market positions and the Australian political-economic context, only limited, mainly individual, expressions of agency were found.},

  abstract = {This study uses stated preference experiments to examine labour market preferences of 309 workers retrenched by the Australian automotive industry for non-pecuniary job attributes denoting job quality and meaningfulness. We find that autonomy and employer reputation for good work policies and practices are the two most important non-pecuniary job attributes, with compensating wage differentials of roughly \$5 per hour for greater autonomy and better employer reputation. Job security and skill utilisation are also important, but less so, with compensating wage differentials between \$1 and \$3 per hour for greater security and fewer training requirements. Workers' strongest preference is not for a particular type of work, but rather for a particular type of employer, suggesting that labour market policy might pay more attention to regulating the quality of workplaces.},
