# Apprentices

Australia is experiencing a skills shortage. The factors which are driving this shortage include:

**a lack of opportunities for apprenticeships**

Current economic and policy settings do not incentivise firms to invest in developing the skilled workforce they rely on. Skills development and training has become the responsibility of the worker - not the firm. It is difficult for individual workers to manage the required time off, and the cost for training. This means the government is forced to step in and attempt to address the issue through subsidies to employers and the skilled migration system. This incentive structure is wrong - the less industry invest in skills, the more support they receive. Creating a priority list with higher subsidies for employers will not break the pattern. Government must introduce measures to adjust the incentive structure - such as a skills levy - that make it unprofitable for firms to neglect workforce development.

**poverty-level wages for apprentices**

-   

-   Low wages are a major barrier to apprenticeship completion. A 2018 AMWU survey found over 70% of apprentices cited pay as a key reason for dropping out, and national completion rates remain below 50%. Apprentices typically earn between \$27,762 and \$44,432 per year - less than the \$33,800 median cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment in Sydney. The maths does not work. Subsidies should go directly to apprentices to offset poverty wages and make skills acquisition financially viable, while still encouraging firms to take on apprentices.

-   

-   The AMWU views award wages and the national minimum wage rate, which provides starting apprentices with sub-minimal wages, as an unjust and unsustainable wage outcome for apprentices. The systemic underpayment of apprentices feeds the exploitative model of cheap labour for unscrupulous employers lawfully paying less than minimum wage for labour.

-   

**a monopsonotistic labour market which suppresses the wages of skilled workers.**

·       Human capital theory assumes workers will develop skills to earn higher wages aligned with their productivity. But in Australia’s concentrated labour markets, workers are underpaid relative to their skills, which weakens incentives to invest in training. Research confirms this problem. The solution is to lift minimum pay rates closer to market productivity levels, ensuring skilled workers are properly rewarded and that training delivers fair returns. 

The current incentive scheme subsidises firms that fail to invest in training, creating perverse outcomes. It has generated a profitable industry for some registered training organisations, while delivering poor value to taxpayers and apprentices. To avoid repeating policy failure, subsidies must be redirected to apprentices - to cover the costs of tools, or working away from home - and not employers.
