    "text": "What is Industry Planning\nIndustry Planning is about developing a strategy for the direction of the economy. It can take two forms. One, in favour since the 1980s, prioritises market forces and price signals, letting private capital dictate the structure of the economy into one which generates the most profit. Under this approach, Australia’s economy has become fundamentally weaker, with a completely hollowed out industrial structure. As such, we are now over-reliant on bulk exporting raw minerals, with the economic and social opportunities from value-added manufacturing activities occurring offshore. This approach also has led to a severe vulnerability in our economy from external shocks, and geopolitical instability. These outcomes should not be seen as inevitable. Rejecting the concept of industrial policy and strategy is itself a strategy.\nThe other form of Industry Planning is an active strategy which seeks to prioritise and develop certain sectors of the economy. It is primarily a strategy of identifying what we want to be able to do and what we want to be able to make. The manufacturing sector is key to this strategy. Manufacturing generates high returns to the economy, and to society, through innovation and productivity growth, investment in research and development, and its linkages to other key sectors of the economy like agriculture and mining. Active industrial policy and government interventions have been gaining traction in other parts of the world as nations seek to secure their supply chains, boost domestic manufacturing output, and create high quality jobs.\nIndustry Planning primarily requires an understanding of what, when, and where. It focuses on the creation of new markets for products and services, rather than on fixing market failures in existing sectors. These new markets are job and value creating, and are aligned with broader national missions, such as de-carbonisation or re-industrialisation.",

    "text": "Planning: What\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhere do want to get to, given current strengths and weaknesses?\n\n\nOpportunity identification is a key aspect of Industry Planning. This requires formally identifying existing and future opportunities, and confirming these opportunities against a set of criteria, including:\n\ncurrent and future strengths and weaknesses\ncompetitors and suppliers\ninternational market conditions and industry demand characteristics\nminimum efficient scale and barriers to entry\nthe size and economic significance of the opportunity\ndecisive points in the supply chain\n\nAustralian Industrial Transformation Institute (2021)\nThrough this approach, dedicated sectoral plans can be developed, for each of the identified target industries or sectors. It is also important to consider the impact of emerging technologies and business models on the future of work, including their relevance to existing industries, and potential future industries, as well as how our current capabilities, and areas of potential competitive advantage can align with gaps and opportunities in global and domestic supply chains.\n\n\nPlanning: When\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow do we get from where we are, to where we want to be?\n\n\nA pathway for development from where we are to where we want to be needs to consider specific strategies, interventions, policies and programs. Through this, sector strategy roadmaps can be developed, with defined targets and timelines. The question of timing can also be factored in for regions undergoing industry closure which need jobs.\n\n\nPlanning: Where\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhich locations should be prioritised for targeted industry investment?\n\n\nHaving a plan in place can help regions facing industry closure or workforce transition. Knowing what industry development to prioritise creates opportunities for job creation in regions facing job losses. Industry closure is accompanied with dates, providing a timeline for when job losses will occur, and when new jobs will be needed. Waiting for each announcement to start thinking about the number of workers affected, their skills, and support required risks regional decay, population outflow, and negative psychosocial impacts. Additionally, it is costly, time consuming, and inefficient to continually be undertaking. A plan for industry development with associated targets and timelines means that opportunities can be aligned with closures, projects are ready to roll out when required, and jobs are created in time to utilise the skills of impacted workers.\nIndustry Planning also has the benefit of using demand side levers to promote investment in products and services for industry to provide. The Government is thus able to use its substantial buying power through procurement policies to achieve its goals. Industry Planning focuses on the creation of new markets, not simply fixing market failures in existing markets. By defining the markets to be created, Government policy can be used as a lever to create high paying, high quality jobs, build local supply chains - providing sovereign capability, and provides a pathway for workforces impacted by industry closure to find meaningful employment in adjacent industries, and do so in a way which minimises negative impacts.\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Industrial Transformation Institute. 2021. “Manufacturing Transformation: High Value Manufacturing for the 21st Century.” 15.

    "text": "2.1 Large scale job loss overview\nThe best worker support program will be useless without good quality jobs to transition into. The creation of good quality jobs must be a core focus of all transition plans.\nLarge scale job loss, industry closure, company closure, and industrial disruption are often used interchangeably – regardless, the displacement of workers as a result of this kind of disruption has been, and will continue to be, a significant feature of established and emerging economies. Whether that is because of decarbonisation, climate change, automation, structural adjustments or business model innovation (Barnes, et al., 2021; Beale, 2024) is irrelevant. The intersection of these factors is likely to lead to more frequent, wide-spread, and concurrent disruptions. Which, if not adequately addressed, will compound the more serious medium- and long-term impacts of large-scale layoffs.\nLikewise, the further along the decarbonisation ‘pathway’ we progress the more complex transition becomes - as company closures become industry closures and workers become more dependent on emergent and emerging industries.\nFrom a workers’ perspective, largescale layoffs are a similar experience regardless of the reason. In any case, large-scale job losses pose three central and interrelated problems: what happens to the workers; to the industry; and to the region - in the immediate aftermath and over the medium and long term.\nThe Albanese government passed the Net Zero Authority Bill 2024 (The Bill) and established the Net Zero Authority (The Authority). Both of which cover the - whole or part - closure of a coal-fired or gas-fired power stations.\nThis document is intended as a guide for unions seeking to navigate and mitigate the impact on workers at closure of gas- and coal- fired power stations and large-scale closures and industrial disruptions not covered by The Authority. It distils learnings and best practice from recent closures in Australia to assist unions to respond quickly and effectively to the announcement of a large-scale layoffs.\nThe impact of any given closure both shapes, and is shaped by, the economic and regional setting in which it occurs. No two shocks are the same, and so we must be cautious about any attempts to identically replicate success stories - what worked in one instance will not necessarily do so in another.\nClosure interventions require a clear understanding of the severity of the problem to inform the level of support needed to mitigate both the direct and indirect short-term and long-term flow-on impacts. Effective management of large-scale job losses require a holistic transition response that simultaneously considers people and place, jobs and skills, and goals and strategies - now and into the future.\nThis document supports early union engagement by providing an overview of the impacts and common risk factors following large scale layoffs and actions unions should consider advocating for. While the scale and shape of support may change, the components remain largely the same.\nThis is intended to supplement any in-house expertise and help reduce replicating work. It provides an overview of common individual and structural risk factors for workers in transition.\nPast closures show us that without proper support, large-scale layoffs can have serious individual, regional and national repercussions. They can have a devastating and lasting – sometimes intergenerational - financial and psycho-social impact on workers, their families, and their communities (Spoehr, 2014; Beale, 2022; Beer, et al., 2006; Barnes & Weller, 2020).\nThe first step to managing an industry closure requires an understanding of the context in which the closure is occurring. A survey of the impacted workers should be undertaken as soon as possible to get a clear understanding of the workforce and tailor the response accordingly. The survey should include employer and contract type, role, qualifications and skills, age, gender, migrant status, and employment tenure. Likewise, the local employment landscape needs to be mapped to understand what opportunities are available to manage the transition.\nWith proper planning, an industry closure is an opportunity for industry and regional development. This requires accurate mapping of the relationship between different jobs in the region, and how best to apply the skills available in these jobs into new areas of strategic, regional, or national importance.\nWorkers and their communities should not be left to bear the brunt of business decisions, and a closure/transition should not be considered a success even if most of the affected population has returned to a pre-crisis level, if others have been pushed into acute stress.",

    "section": "2.2 IMPACTS OF LARGE-SCALE JOB LOSS - Individual, Community and Regional",
    "text": "2.2 IMPACTS OF LARGE-SCALE JOB LOSS - Individual, Community and Regional\nThis section provides an overview of some of the serious impacts of transitions to inform and empower workers and their representatives.\n\n2.2.1 Individual Impacts\nIndividual impacts are not distributed evenly. Older workers, lower-paid workers, those from new migrant backgrounds, or who do not speak English fluently, are more vulnerable to periods of long-term or cyclical unemployment (Bankwest Curtin Economics, 2018).\nBeyond the loss of income, large scale job loss also poses a real risk to workers physical and mental health through periods of extended unemployment and the loss of social support networks (Davies, et al., 2017). In addition to feelings of grief and loss, risks to individuals include, but are not limited to, increased rates of unhealthy behaviour (smoking, drinking, and drug misuse), anxiety and depression, higher rates of morbidity and mortality, and in serious cases suicidal ideation (Beer, et al., 2006; Marmot, et al., 2006; Beale, 2022).\nThis includes the exacerbation of the well-established ill-health impacts of unemployment because mass redundancy can lead to an increased competition for work, extending individual periods of unemployment and pushing the impact into the community beyond the directly impacted workforce.\nA significant finding from Beale’s (2022) study of the closure of the automotive industry in South Australia was that retrenched workers who did find secure work did not report any poor mental health outcomes. This underscores the importance of quality of work as a protective factor for these workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEffective transition programs need to invest in the social, emotional, and financial support of retrenched workers and their families. Holistic support programs are about more than just finding work.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Impacts on Families\nUnemployment, and specifically non-voluntary retrenchment, can also significantly impact the mental and physical health of workers’ spouses, children, and extended families. Some reports indicate that the effect on spouses’ health can be ‘almost as high’ as redundant workers (Davies, et al., 2017).\nThe flood of retrenched workers can displace existing job seekers who are less recently employed extending and compounding their period of unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nWhenever possible transition support should be extended to the families of impacted workers and transition plans should also beware of exacerbating disadvantage in a region.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Impacts on Community and Regions\nIn addition to the overarching economic environment, transition pathways are also shaped by their local and regional context. The regional context includes:\n\nContractors and the immediate supply chain\nother businesses and industries in the region\nthe community and support networks that sustain the people who live and work there\n\nThe towns or regions in which closures occur tend to feel the impacts most acutely. However, the impacts of contemporary closures are also dispersed over a wider zone than closures of the past and are likely to extend beyond the clearly defined borders of local government (Chapain & Murie, 2008).\nSingle-industry regions are at greater risk of extended periods of unemployment because it is less likely that the available work will require the same skillsets as the industries shedding labour (Beale & Gamble, 2024; Beer & Evans, 2010; Spoehr, 2014).\nThe loss of a major employer can also have a detrimental economic impact on local business activity through the loss of income to the supply-chain as well as local stores and cafes frequented by the workforce. Inter-industry linkages mean that small businesses outside the impacted industry can suffer negative outcomes – if the population shrinks or retrenched workers reduce their spending.\nThe loss of cash and in-kind donations to local schools, not-for-profits and other community organisations that are common practice for larger businesses can also have serious community impacts. This might seem a flippant consideration, but these donations often make up a significant portion of a community club’s income. This is especially important given the role such organisations play as ‘third spaces’ in building community resilience and combatting social isolation.\nThis is an important consideration when gathering political and community support: the impact of large-scale layoffs is not the exclusive domain of the retrenched worker.",

    "text": "2.3 PART ONE: Risk Factors and Protective Factors\nThis section provides a brief overview of common risk and protective factors following large scale layoffs. It provides short insight into why each factor is a concern and what action can be taken to counteract it.\n\n2.3.1 Individual Risk Factors\nTransition support needs to be aware of individual risk factors. A survey of the impacted workers should be undertaken as soon as possible to get a clear understanding of the workforce and tailor the response accordingly. The survey should include employer, contract type, position, qualifications and skills, age, gender, migrant status, and employment tenure. Likewise, policy makers need to map the local employment landscape to understand what opportunities are available to manage the transition.\n\nEffective transition programs need to conduct mapping of the workforce to identify the proportion of at-risk groups and to assist with skills mapping and matching.\n\n\n2.3.1.1 Employment type\nTransition outcomes can vary significantly between the ‘main’ closing employer and contracted and supply chain workers. Historically, this has been because contracted and supply chain workers have not been able to access the same level of transition support and access to services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nAll impacted workers, including those who are contractors, or linked through supply chains, must have access to the same level of transition support.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.2 Age\nOlder workers are more vulnerable to long-term and cyclical insecure employment and unemployment (Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, 2018; Davies et al., 2017). Older workers often find themselves working lower-quality jobs after a closure or forced into early retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nThere is a real danger for workers who fall into the gap between being “too young to retire and too old to retrain”. Although these categories are largely socially constructed, they have been shown to have material impacts. These workers are likely to need extra and targeted support. For example, this might include digital literacy training.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.3 Gender\nMany of the industries most likely to be directly impacted by decarbonisation are male dominated. Male labour force participation rates have been falling for decades and non-voluntary part-time work for men has increased dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nGendered impacts manifest differently across different industries, but it is important to understand the gendered nature of the impacted workforce and of the broader industry.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.4 Migrant workers\nMigrant workers can be vulnerable to long periods of insecure employment or unemployment after a large-scale layoff and their experience of it may be exacerbated by the absence of citizenship rights (Barnes & Weller, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nMigrant workers may need greater, and culturally and linguistically targeted, assistance to ensure they find suitable, good quality work in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.5 Employment Tenure and Quality of Existing Work\nWorkers who have enjoyed long term good quality work and are financially stable may be insulated from some of the more immediate and negative aspects of industrial disruption. In contrast younger and insecurely employer workers are unlikely to have a personal financial safety net to cushion the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nA long tenure in a stable job may act as a protective factor but is not a guarantee. It should not be assumed older workers nearing retirement will be financially secure.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.6 Transition funding and support programs\nWorker’s transition funding and support programs should be made available as soon as possible and remain available for a period after retrenchment. After the auto closure, workers had to access federal, state and company funding through three separate processes – that also had separate guidelines. This was confusing and ultimately meant many workers did not access all the retraining funding that was available to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nWorkers should have access to evidence informed advice that helps them identify growth industries to increase the likelihood any training will help them get a job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nWherever possible retraining funding should be pooled, meaning it is available in one place. As a guide, auto workers in SA were eligible for a cumulative $3,800 to $4,300. These figures are inclusive of State, Federal, and Company funding - the variation is dependent on whether they were working at Holden or in the supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Structural Risk Factors\n\n2.3.2.1 Quality of work\nHigh rates of insecure work in the broader economic landscape is a pernicious problem for transition programs. Likewise, worker’s employment outcomes are unlikely to be static or linear. Workers who take on lower quality work after a closure are more likely to churn through multiple jobs and are at greater risk of experiencing negative financial and physical and mental health outcomes.\nWithout adequate and targeted support workers will struggle to find work of equal or greater quality than the jobs they have lost.\nHistorically, transition programs have focused on getting workers into new employment as quickly as possible – often at the expense of job quality. And, if present at all, their approach to job quality has often been grounded in the somewhat euphemistic ‘expectation management’ – that is, preparing workers to accept lower quality work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nGood quality jobs need to be a core focus of all transition support programs. Without targeted support it is ill-advised to assume that the first job a worker finds will be the right job and pushing workers into poor quality work just pushes the problem into the future.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Timing – The Importance of an Early Intervention and a Long Tail\nIndustrial disruption presents both short- and long- term problems: the initial wave of unemployment and then the ongoing regional socio-economic impacts. These elements are interrelated: in general, the greater forewarning workers, business, and government have of a closure, the better. Greater warning provides time to plan and, assuming the time provided by the forewarning is well utilised, the processes put in place moderate some of the more severe and lasting negative ramifications – known as the aftershocks. \nEqually important, however, is ensuring transition support has a ‘long tail’. Research from past closures warn that many of the most negative social problems do not emerge for 18 to 24 months, when retrenched workers’ payouts diminish and holidays end (Henderson & Shutt, 2004).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nEarly ‘intelligent intervention’ beginning with the forewarning of the closure (be it a formal announcement or otherwise) and carrying on long after the last day on the job is key to handling closures well (Spoehr, 2014; Beale, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Exploitative training providers\nIt is important to be aware of unscrupulous private training providers that can appear following the announcement of large-scale layoffs – especially if that announcement is accompanied by re-training funding for impacted workers.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecommendation\n\n\n\nWorkers should be warned and assisted to identify genuine retraining opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.4 Single industry towns – population outflow\nIn regions highly dependent on one industry, large scale layoffs risk fuelling population outflow.\nIndustrial linkages mean that the impact of a closure spreads beyond the directly impacted workers to other industries in the region, causing additional employment and industry output losses.\nImpacted workers may move to find work and, in serious cases, this can create a chain reaction in the broader population.",

    "text": "3.1 Economic Complexity in Australia\nEconomic complexity is a measure of the knowledge or capabilities embedded with an economy.\nWhen we say capabilities - we mean the knowledge, skills, human and physical capital, and other endowments such as access to raw materials or climate, that a country or region possesses, enabling it to produce certain goods or services. Capabilities can be determined by trade data, or other data sources such as employment by industry.\nIn principle, the more capabilities a country has (i.e., the higher its economic complexity), the more ways these capabilities can be combined to create new or unique products which can not be created elsewhere.\nEconomic complexity quantifies and describes the differences in capabilities between economies at a point in time. Differences in economic complexity can explain why there are differences in per-capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Hausmann 2013).\nA key outcome from economic complexity analysis is the importance of path dependency. The future development patterns of a country or region can be predicted based on its current capabilities. This builds on a theoretical concept called relatedness.\nRelatedness is a measure of the probability that a country or region who is specialised in one product will also specialise in another product.\nSome examples include:\nRelatedness between jobs or products can be due to technological sophistication, knowledge spill overs from one activity to another, similarities in inputs or outputs in value chains, or the presence of requisite institutions.\nIn Australia, there has been a continuous decline in the contribution of the manufacturing sector to overall GDP, and manufacturing employment to the total workforce. While de-industrialisation has been seen across other countries, the decline in Australia has not only relative to other sectors, but absolute. The decline of manufacturing in Australia was punctuated by announcements in 2013 and 2014 that local automotive manufacturing would come to an end. As such, the decline in Australia’s ranking in economic complexity, as shown in Figure 3.1 has been rapid. Australia’s economic complexity now ranks 102nd, similar to Namibia, Ghana, and Botswana.\nOutside of the broader trend of de-industrialisation, the question remains: what industries can replace those which are in decline, or have been lost? Research shows that different policy responses are required depending on the current level of complexity (Hidalgo 2021)\nFigure 3.1: Economic Complexity Index, Australia, Canada, Germany",

    "section": "3.2 Embedding Economic Complexity into Industry Policy",
    "text": "3.2 Embedding Economic Complexity into Industry Policy\nThe deliberate lack of industry policy in Australia in favour of policy based on the rationality of markets has resulted in an economy which prioritises sectors and activities that generate the highest returns to capital.\nActive and directional industry policy instead prioritises sectors and activities that provide higher returns to society. Such sectors:\n\nembody greater knowledge intensity and have high positive spill-overs (for example, local/domestic processing and value-adding of minerals compared to dig and ship)\ncan assist with large scale societal challenges, such as the decarbonisation/net zero agenda (and capturing the economic benefits), building and retaining sovereign capabilities, and generating inclusive economic growth (reversing inequality).\nhave the potential to create high quality and secure jobs\n\nEconomic complexity analysis provides a quantitative evidence base for how to best direct existing industrial capabilities towards building an economy that works better for everyone. Economic complexity is a method for identifying both the existing productive capabilities of a location, but also the links between existing capabilities and potential future capabilities/opportunities.\nThis is not a new idea:\nThe concept of smart specialisation focuses on the importance of location and regional knowledge. Smart specialisation has been used as the basis for industry and innovation policy throughout Europe - to direct regional economies along place-based technological trajectories, based on the existing knowledge present in the region (Rigby and Essletzbichler 1997). Smart specialisation policy realises that - because knowledge is location dependent - improved development outcomes can be created by focussing on distinctive and original areas of specialisation, rather than simply copying what has been successful elsewhere (Dominique Foray, Paul A. David, and Bronwyn Hall 2009) . That is, what has been successful in one region (i.e. Silicon Valley) may not necessarily work in other regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA comprehensive industry policy should be seen as an industrial strategy. The first step of such a strategy requires a formal identification of existing and future opportunities. Economic complexity provides a framework for identifying opportunities based on current industrial capabilities. These opportunities lead to increases in economic complexity, which means more capabilities, skills, and knowledge, and economic growth. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where an industry policy embedded with economic complexity generates opportunities which build complexity which create more opportunities.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Diversification Analysis and Opportunity Identification\nDiversification analysis is the first and most basic method available.

This requires an understanding of the current workforce, and the similarity (or otherwise) of opportunities available for displaced workers.\nEconomic complexity analysis provides a quantitative base for understanding existing capabilities, and the similarities between these capabilities and potential opportunities.\nWith proper planning, industry closure can be an opportunity for regional development, industrial development, and can further national strategic goals such as decarbonisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou need to understand the relationship the relationship between different jobs in the region, and how best to apply the skills available in these jobs into new areas of strategic, regional, or national importance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominique Foray, Paul A.

    "text": "Australia is experiencing a skills shortage. The factors which are driving this shortage include:\na lack of opportunities for apprenticeships\nCurrent economic and policy settings do not incentivise firms to invest in developing the skilled workforce they rely on. Skills development and training has become the responsibility of the worker - not the firm. It is difficult for individual workers to manage the required time off, and the cost for training. This means the government is forced to step in and attempt to address the issue through subsidies to employers and the skilled migration system. This incentive structure is wrong - the less industry invest in skills, the more support they receive. Creating a priority list with higher subsidies for employers will not break the pattern. Government must introduce measures to adjust the incentive structure - such as a skills levy - that make it unprofitable for firms to neglect workforce development.\npoverty-level wages for apprentices\n\n\nLow wages are a major barrier to apprenticeship completion. A 2018 AMWU survey found over 70% of apprentices cited pay as a key reason for dropping out, and national completion rates remain below 50%. Apprentices typically earn between $27,762 and $44,432 per year - less than the $33,800 median cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment in Sydney. The maths does not work. Subsidies should go directly to apprentices to offset poverty wages and make skills acquisition financially viable, while still encouraging firms to take on apprentices.\n\nThe AMWU views award wages and the national minimum wage rate, which provides starting apprentices with sub-minimal wages, as an unjust and unsustainable wage outcome for apprentices. The systemic underpayment of apprentices feeds the exploitative model of cheap labour for unscrupulous employers lawfully paying less than minimum wage for labour.\n\n\na monopsonotistic labour market which suppresses the wages of skilled workers.\n·       Human capital theory assumes workers will develop skills to earn higher wages aligned with their productivity. But in Australia’s concentrated labour markets, workers are underpaid relative to their skills, which weakens incentives to invest in training. Research confirms this problem. The solution is to lift minimum pay rates closer to market productivity levels, ensuring skilled workers are properly rewarded and that training delivers fair returns. \nThe current incentive scheme subsidises firms that fail to invest in training, creating perverse outcomes. It has generated a profitable industry for some registered training organisations, while delivering poor value to taxpayers and apprentices. To avoid repeating policy failure, subsidies must be redirected to apprentices - to cover the costs of tools, or working away from home - and not employers.",

All aspects of the industry are facing increasing pressures from low-cost imports, especially in the face of rising input costs in Australia. Additional uncertainty surrounding international trade policy clouds future investment decisions. Within the steel manufacturing and structural steel fabricating industries, pressures from automation and AI adoption have reduced wage costs and impacted the labour market. Future revenue growth in these sectors may rely on increased demand for green steel – indicating the importance for local manufacturers to invest in these production technologies now.\nBoth the iron and steel casting and forging industries have faced declining revenue over the last five years. Revenue has reduced at an annualized rate of 7.7%, primarily due to the continued impacts of the decline of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry and increased import competition. In iron and steel forging, deteriorating conditions in mining output and railway equipment manufacturing has resulted in an annualised revenue decline of 2.4% through to 2024-25.\nHowever, future growth is predicted as population growth increases pressure on existing infrastructure – increasing demand for multi-unit apartments, townhouses, and railway equipment. The completion of existing large infrastructure projects will dampen future sales without a strong pipeline of additional work. Finally, there is an opportunity through increased demand for wind farm construction to support the iron and steel forging industry.",

The Whyalla steelworks was placed under administration by the South Australian government in February 2025. Both of these operations use blast furnaces to produce steel using iron ore and coal. This process produces significant amounts of carbon dioxide.\nelectric arc furnaces\nModern steel making techniques utilise electric arc furnaces as replacements for blast furnaces. These use significant amounts of electricity, but are more modern and more efficient. An electric arc furnace enables the production of low-carbon steel, including green steel. Electric arc furnaces can produce steel from any combination of recycled scrap steel and direct reduced iron.\nThe electric arc furnace in Collie WA is able to produce steel rebar with 80% fewer emissions - from recycled steel.\nIn-place upgrading of blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces probably requires closure of plants. In Wales at Tata Steel, the transition shut down production for about 2 years, resulting in about 2000 people losing their job.\nIn the UK, a plan to replace two blast furnaces at British Steel Scunthorpe is estimated to impact up to 2,000 steel workers.\nThese investments have cost over 1.25bn pounds each.\ndirect reduced / green iron\nMaking virgin steel using an electric arc furnace requires direct reduced iron.

Revenue declined by an annualised 8.5% through the end of 2023-24.5  Falling demand in aluminium smelting in Australia is attributable to 2.4% of this decline.\nIn contrast, production of aluminium is anticipated to increase over the next few years as global efforts are made to decarbonise the economy. In order to remain competitive, low carbon alumina production initiatives must be prioritised.\nAluminium smelting is the downstream process to Alumina production. Aluminium smelting is an energy intensive process which consumes upwards of 10% of the National Electricity Market. Increases in the production of green energy, leading to more competitive prices, has the potential to decarbonise the aluminium smelting industry. Despite Australia’s dominance in alumina production, it is behind China in the production of aluminium.  Inflated energy costs in Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and uncertainty regarding carbon pricing policy in Australia contribute to volatility in global prices, and uncertainty in local production.\nTable 3: Alumina Production and Aluminium Smelting Financial Trends 6\nAccording to the Australian Aluminium Council7 the sector, in total (including all downstream processing):",

Given the impact on the commercial aviation industry from the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021 Census is likely to represent a significant undercount of employment.\nThe commercial airline industry faced significant challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic, with reduced flights. The industry has since recovered, with revenue now reaching close to pre-pandemic levels.  This recovery, combined with Defence spending, has increased the demand for aircraft maintenance and repair workers.\nThis report is intended to provide guidance about current aircraft manufacturing in Australia, including industry trends, and an overview of our current membership in this sector.\nDomestic airline operation in Australia also contributes to the local workforce for Aircraft Manufacturing and Repair Services – with Qantas employing about 3,300 personnel in their engineering and maintenance branch.\nAdditional Maintenance and Ground Support Employers (AMWU-relevant):\nSpecialised Aviation Support:\nTop Commercial Airlines:\nGeneral Aviation Examples:",

    "text": "13.1 Industry Overview\nOne of the main challenges in assessing the roadside assistance sector is the lack of clear and consistent data. Much of the publicly available information either examines the broader towing sector—which includes both roadside assistance and post-crash vehicle towing—or comes from firms that operate across multiple segments such as roadside assistance, insurance, and towing. This makes it difficult to separate and identify the true sources of profits. As a result, the analysis here draws primarily on sector-wide towing data and individual company reports. While this data is not perfect, it represents the most reliable information currently available.\nAcross the towing segment, revenue has grown steadily at a rate of around 2% since 2012, with some periods of larger fluctuations. It is expected that this trend will continue till the end of the decade. Naturally, the sectors success is largely driven by the number of cars on the road, and whether one breaks down or feels that such a risk exists and thus should purchase a subscription. The other factor affecting the sector is vehicle reliability, as cars improve it is likely that less breakdowns will occur, whilst further, EV adoption, EVs having fewer moving parts, are also likely to disrupt the market. It should also be noted that employment in the sector has grown steadily in recent years, in line with demand for service and revenue, it is expected that this trend will continue. With 3,761 people forecast to be employed within the towing segment by 2030.\nThe primary risk to continued employment growth in the sector is the rise of EVs, and the extent to which their less complex construction will reduce demand for services as breakdowns will become less common. Although, EV charging issues could create a new source of demand within the sector",

This includes around 5,900 people in rolling stock manufacturing.\nAccording to IBISWorld, railway equipment manufacturing and repair in Australia employs almost 10,000 people, up almost 8% since 2020, and is forecast to continue to grow by about 2% into 2030. Revenue has also grown since 2020 by about 0.5% to $4.8bn, and is also forecast to grow by 1.5% into 2030. This growth has been driven by major rail infrastructure projects like the Melbourne Metro Tunnel and Sydney Metro. The demand induced by government spending has resulted in increasing innovation and opportunities for new business growth. The number of businesses in Australia supporting this sector has grown by almost 2% since 2020.
