# Iron and Steel

## Industry Overview

Steel manufacturing in Australia is captured primarily by the ANZSIC groups:

-   Iron and Steel Forging

-   Basic Ferrous Metal Manufacturing

-   Basic Ferrous Metal Product Manufacturing

-   Iron Smelting and Steel production is dominated by BlueScope Steel, who had almost 50% of the market share in 2025.

Overall, the iron and steel industries rely on demand in the residential construction, mining, vehicles, and infrastructure sectors to maintain revenue stability. All aspects of the industry are facing increasing pressures from low-cost imports, especially in the face of rising input costs in Australia. Additional uncertainty surrounding international trade policy clouds future investment decisions. Within the steel manufacturing and structural steel fabricating industries, pressures from automation and AI adoption have reduced wage costs and impacted the labour market. Future revenue growth in these sectors may rely on increased demand for green steel – indicating the importance for local manufacturers to invest in these production technologies now.

Both the iron and steel casting and forging industries have faced declining revenue over the last five years. Revenue has reduced at an annualized rate of 7.7%, primarily due to the continued impacts of the decline of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry and increased import competition. In iron and steel forging, deteriorating conditions in mining output and railway equipment manufacturing has resulted in an annualised revenue decline of 2.4% through to 2024-25.

However, future growth is predicted as population growth increases pressure on existing infrastructure – increasing demand for multi-unit apartments, townhouses, and railway equipment. The completion of existing large infrastructure projects will dampen future sales without a strong pipeline of additional work. Finally, there is an opportunity through increased demand for wind farm construction to support the iron and steel forging industry.

## Opportunities

what and where are the opportunities for growth?

-   investment is heading towards electric arc furnaces as replacements for blast furnaces. These use significant amounts of electricity, but are more modern, and more efficient, and should replace old/under-invested blast furnaces.

-   An electric arc furnace also opens the opportunity for manufacturing low-carbon steel. Because you can power the furnace with renewable energy. An electric arc furnace can also use 100% recyclced scrape steel as an input - like what has been set-up in Collie, WA.

-   In-place upgrading of blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces probably requires closure of plants. In Wales at Tata Steel, the transition shut down production for about 2 years, resulting in about 2000 people losing their job.

-   In the UK, a plan to replace two blast furnaces at British Steel Scunthorpe is estimated to impact up to 2,000 steel workers.

-   These investments have cost over 1.25bn pounds each.

### Legislation

-   There are a lot of businesses operating in iron and steel industries across Australia - more than 3,000.

<!-- -->

-   Multi-employer bargaining

-   Same Job Same Pay

### Government Funding

-   is there an opportunity to use multi-employer bargaining, same job same pay, or other tools?

-   is there an opportunity to use FMIA
