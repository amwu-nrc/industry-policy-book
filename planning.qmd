## A Plan for Industry Development

Industry Planning is about developing a strategy for the direction of the economy. It can take two forms. One, in favour since the 1980s, prioritises market forces and price signals, letting private capital dictate the structure of the economy. Under this approach, Australia's economy has become fundamentally weaker, with a completely hollowed out industrial structure. As such, we are now over-reliant on bulk exporting raw minerals, providing the economic and social opportunities from value-added manufacturing activities to occur offshore. This approach also has introduced a severe vulnerability from external shocks, and geopolitical instability. This should not be considered an inevitability. Rejecting the concept of industrial policy and strategy is itself a strategy.

The other form of Industry Planning is an active strategy which seeks to prioritise and develop certain sectors of the economy. It is primarily a strategy of identifying what we want to be able to do and what we want to be able to make. The manufacturing sector is key to this strategy. Manufacturing generates high returns to the economy, and to society, through innovation and productivity growth, investment in research and development, and its linkages to other key sectors of the economy like agriculture and mining. Active and deliberate direction-setting industrial policy and interventions have been gaining traction in other parts of the world, especially in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic.

This identification should take into consideration broader national and sub-national goals, as well as regional strengths and weaknesses. The second part of Industry Planning concerns timing. When should focus be placed on building a new industry? When are jobs needed? The question of timing is also important when considering regions undergoing industrial transition or closure. This is the culmination of industry planning: - what industry should we prioritise - where should we focus its development - when is the most beneficial time to build

Industry Planning has significant advantages for means that the Government can use its substantial buying power, through procurement policies, to achieve its goals. \`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\` It is the creation of markets, generating demand for products and services for industry to provide. Industry Planning means that government policy can be used as a lever to: - create high paying, high quality jobs - build local supply chains, providing sovereign capability - provide a pathway for a workforce impacted by industry closure to find meaningful employment in adjacent industries, and do so in a way which minimises negative impacts from industry closure.

-   Market creation
-   

requires an understanding of the time frame of industry closure, as well as industry development. Preparation

, and developing a pathway to achieve. - Identify what it is we want to be able to do? - What it is we want to be able to make? - Alignment with industry policy goals of the government. - Like - decarbonisation. That is a goal. How do we get there? - Import a lot of solar panels and wind turbines? - Build and develop local industry/supply chain - We might need to be able to build or assemble solar panels, wind turbines, transmission equipment. - We might need to be able to repair, and maintain this equipment. - - Align regional disruptions with regional opportunities. Can industrial opportunities align with the skills profile of displaced workers?

## Why Plan?

To - Industry policy requires planning. - Industry closures happen. The closure is accompanied with dates - This provides a timeline for: - When job losses will occur in a region - When new jobs are needed - Waiting for each announcement to start thinking about: - Who is affected - What their skills are - What the opportunities for transition are - What support is needed - Is costly, time consuming, and inefficient. It's also a lot of duplicated work - - Planning is about identifying early: - What needs to be done - What can be done - What should be done - Such that projects are ready to roll out when required - Further, society is under significant pressure on multiple fronts, including: - automation of the workforce, and technological change - climate change and decarbonisation - security of supply chains - social and political uncertainty
